          <strong>Margaret Heafield Hamilton</strong> (born August 17, 1936)<a href="#" class="ref">[1]</a> is <a>a computer scientist</a>, <a>systems engineer</a>, and <a>business owner</a>. She was Director of the Software Engineering Division of the <a>MIT Instrumentation Laboratory</a>, which developed on-board flight software for the <a>Apollo space program</a>.<a href="#" class="ref">[2]</a> In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, Hamilton's team's work prevented an abort of landing on the moon.<a href="#" class="ref">[3]</a> In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in <a>Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>. The company was developed around the <a>Universal Systems Language</a> based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact (DBTF) for systems and software design.<a href="#" class="ref">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports concerned with the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.

        <h2>Early life<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          Margaret Heafield was born to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (n√©e Partington).<a href="#" class="ref">[5]</a> She graduated from Hancock High School in 1954, and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from <a>Earlham College</a> in 1958.<a href="#" class="ref">[6]</a> After graduation, she briefly taught high school math and French while her husband finished earning his undergraduate degree. She moved to <a>Boston, Massachusetts,</a> with the intention of doing graduate study in <a>abstract mathematics</a> at <a>Brandeis University</a>. In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the <a>LGP-30</a> and the <a>PDP-1</a> computers (at <a>Marvin Minsky's Project MAC</a>) for professor <a>Edward Norton Lorenz</a> in the <a>meteorology</a> department.<a href="#" class="ref">[1]</a><a href="#" class="ref">[7]</a> At that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.<a href="#" class="ref">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the <a>SAGE Project</a> at <a>Lincoln Labs</a>, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first <a>AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)</a>, to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the <a>Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories</a>.
