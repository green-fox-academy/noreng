        </p>
        <p>
          Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports concerned with the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.
        </p>

        <h2>Early life<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          Margaret Heafield was born to Kenneth Heafield and Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).<a href="#" class="ref">[5]</a> She graduated from Hancock High School in 1954, and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from <a>Earlham College</a> in 1958.<a href="#" class="ref">[6]</a> After graduation, she briefly taught high school math and French while her husband finished earning his undergraduate degree. She moved to <a>Boston, Massachusetts,</a> with the intention of doing graduate study in <a>abstract mathematics</a> at <a>Brandeis University</a>. In 1960 she took an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting weather on the <a>LGP-30</a> and the <a>PDP-1</a> computers (at <a>Marvin Minsky's Project MAC</a>) for professor <a>Edward Norton Lorenz</a> in the <a>meteorology</a> department.<a href="#" class="ref">[1]</a><a href="#" class="ref">[7]</a> At that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.<a href="#" class="ref">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the <a>SAGE Project</a> at <a>Lincoln Labs</a>, where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first <a>AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)</a>, to search for "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the <a>Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>NASA<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          Hamilton then joined the <a>Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> at MIT, which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission. She eventually became the director and supervisor of software programming for Apollo and Skylab.<a href="#" class="ref">[8]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          At <a>NASA</a>, Hamilton's team was responsible for helping pioneer the Apollo on-board guidance software required to navigate and land on the Moon, and its multiple variations used on numerous missions (including the subsequent <a>Skylab</a>).<a href="#" class="ref">[2]</a> She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when computer science and software engineering courses or disciplines were non-existent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her areas of expertise include <a>systems design</a> and <a>software development</a>, <a>enterprise</a> and <a>process modelling</a>, development paradigm, formal <a>systems modeling</a> languages, system-oriented objects for systems modelling and development, automated life-cycle environments, methods for maximizing <a>software reliability</a> and <a>reuse</a>, <a>domain analysis</a>, <a>correctness</a> by built-in language properties, open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle automation, <a>quality assurance</a>, seamless integration, <a>error detection and recovery</a> techniques, <a>man-machine interface</a> systems, <a>operating systems</a>, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management techniques.<a href="#" class="ref">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          She was one of those who developed concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, and <a>Human-in-the-loop</a> decision capability, which became the foundation for modern, ultra-reliable software design.
        </p>

        <h3>Apollo 11<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h3>
        <p>
          Hamilton's work in the Apollo Guidance Computer software prevented an abort of the Apollo 11 Moon landing:[3] Three minutes before the Lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with incoming data, because the rendezvous radar system (not necessary for landing) updated an involuntary counter in the computer, which stole cycles from the computer. Due to its robust architecture, the computer was able to keep running; the Apollo onboard flight software was developed using an asynchronous executive so that higher priority jobs (important for landing) could interrupt lower priority jobs. The fault was attributed to a faulty checklist.

        <h2>Businesses<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          From 1976 through 1984, Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS), that created a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology.[11][12][13]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1986, she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of Development Before The Fact (DBTF) for systems design and software development.[4][14][15][16]
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          Hamilton is credited with coining the term "software engineering".[17] In this field she was one of those who developed the concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, end-to-end testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability, such as priority displays which then became the foundation for ultra reliable software design.[18]

        <h2>Personal life<span class="edit-link"><a href="#">edit</a></span></h2>
        <p>
          She met her husband James Cox Hamilton while at Earlham College. They married in the late 1950s after Heafield earned her bachelor's degree. They had a daughter together named Lauren. The couple eventually divorced.[20]
